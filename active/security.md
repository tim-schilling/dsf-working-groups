# Security Team

## Scope of responsibilities

The security team is responsible for [Djangoâ€™s security policies](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/). This includes:

- Reviewing security reports via security@djangoproject.com
- Evaluating and patching confirmed security issues
- Communicating with reporters
- Communicating with the public about security releases
- Communicating with operating-system vendors and other distributors of Django

## Initial membership

- Chair:
- Co-Chair:
- Steering Council Liaison (must be an active Steering Council member; may be the same as Chair/Co-Chair): Carlton Gibson
- Other members:
  - Adam Johnson
  - Carlton Gibson
  - Jacob Walls
  - Jake Howard
  - James Bennett
  - Mariusz Felisiak
  - Markus Holtermann
  - Michael Manfre
  - Natalia Bidart
  - Paul McMillan
  - Sarah Boyce
  - Shai Berger
  - Simon Charette

## Future membership

Answer the following questions here:

- Who is eligible to join? Any volunteer, or are there specific requirements?
- How do people who want to join sign up / volunteer / express interest?
- How will decisions on adding/removing members be handled?

For the last question, we suggest picking one of the following:

- Direct membership: new members may self-nominate; the team/WG will vote (50%+1) to approve/deny new members; the team/WG will directly vote on new Chair/Co-Chairs. (This is the appropriate model for most team/WGs).
- Board-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Board. The Board must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive, community based teams/WGs, such as the Ops Team, or WGs with large budgets ($thousands/year).)
- Steering Council-managed: new members may self-nominate, but must be voted in by the Steering Council. The Steering Council must approve changes to the Chair/Co-Chair. (This is the appropriate model for sensitive teams/WGs, such as the Mergers team.)

## Budget

No budget is required at this time. This will be reviewed at least annually.
Any changes to the budget may be requested from the board.

## Comms

The team holds it discussions on the mailing list: TODO

## Reporting

The security team reports back to the community through the [Django Release Announcements thread](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-release-announcements/655/96) on the Forum.
